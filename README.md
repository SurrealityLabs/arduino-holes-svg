# arduino-holes-svg
An SVG template for making a pogo pin test jig for Arduino-compatible boards.

SVG colours are set for my particular template for a Trotec Speedy300 laser cutter - red is first cut, green is second cut. Pogo pin hole diameters are set to 1.70mm, which is a good fit for pogo pin holders from Dangerous Prototypes in my experience.
